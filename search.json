    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe 40-yard dash is one of the most exciting events tested at the NFL Combine. Prospects set-up in a three-point stance and, after a brief pause, start of their own volition. Time begins when the hand is released from the ground and stops when the player breaks the plane at 40 yards. Sprint times are typically five seconds or less.\nIn those five seconds, players display their ability to produce force and power. Within position groups, the fastest players are drafted earlier and have more career success. Unfortunately, much of the data surrounding their career success and abilities are descriptive in nature. Research has also shown that the fastest 40-yard splits are run by players with the greatest top-speeds. Yet there is very little evidence that the 40-yard dash translates to an athlete’s on-field mechanical sprint abilities.\nPlayers rarely reach their top-speed during games. Passing plays that last 4 to 6 seconds challenge receivers to create space between themselves and the defender. It is their ability to juke, deke, cut, and feint that creates this space. Conversely, defenders attempt to remain in proximity of the receiver by mirroring these changes in speed and direction. These factors affect a player’s ability to reach their top-speed.\nThis paper explores the relationship between an athlete’s sprint kinetics and pass completion rates. Specifically, it aims to explore whether modeling an athlete’s mechanical sprint profile to cover a given distance can influence pass outcomes. Background information on modeling an athlete’s mechanical sprint abilities is provided as a framework for new methodologies that can be applied in-game."

    "text": "2 Athlete Biomechanics\nFurusawa and colleagues (1927) first modeled sprint kinetics and kinematics by analyzing a sprinter’s center of mass while running. Their approach utilizing inverse dynamics was a simple method of assessing a sprinter’s biomechanical abilities and horizontal force production. The methods Furusawa and colleagues (1927) introduced remain steadfast in the face of technological advancements.\nModeling sprint kinetics provides sports scientists with insight into a player’s lower-body neuromuscular potential. For example, this information provides practitioners with the understanding of an athlete’s strengths and weaknesses. Currently, player profiling is impractical when working with positional tracking data. Game data does not often comprise of players reaching maximal speeds with maximal effort, a key factor in force-velocity-power profiling. Instead, researchers resort to profiling athletes at the Combine’s 40-yard dash event. They hope that these athlete profiles translate to in-game sprint performance.\nAn emerging field in sports science is in-situ player profiling. This concept employs positional tracking data to model a player’s force-velocity-power profile. Doing so provides insight into how events like the 40-yard dash translate to on-field mechanical sprint capabilities. Presently there is only one publication, a proof-of-concept in men’s professional soccer, that utilizes GPS data to model force-velocity profiles. This submission expands on the in-situ concept in professional American Football.\n\n2.1 Sprint Kinetics\nThere is very little difference between prospects’ mechanical abilities; within all position groups, fast and slow players express the same sprint kinetics. The area in which players differ is their ability to accelerate. Furusawa et al. (1927) discovered that all humans reach their maximal speeds following the function:\n\\[\nv(t) = v_\\max \\cdot (1-e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau})\\\\\n\\]\nwhere \\(v(t)\\) represents an athlete’s velocity at time \\(t\\), \\(v_\\max\\) is an athlete’s maximum speed, and \\(\\tau\\) is the acceleration constant calculated:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{v_\\max} {a_\\max}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_\\max\\) is an athlete’s maximum acceleration. Building on the functions above, acceleration was modeled:\n\\[\na(t) = (\\frac {v_\\max}{\\tau}) \\cdot e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau}\\\\\n\\]\nwhere \\(a(t)\\) represents acceleration at time \\(t\\). Distance covered over time was also modeled:\n\\[\n\\Delta d (t)= v_\\max \\cdot ((t + \\tau) \\cdot e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau}) - (v_\\max \\cdot \\tau)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta d (t)\\) represents the distance travelled from point \\(d_0\\) to \\(d_i\\) at time \\(t\\).\nThe plot below shows two athletes: athlete A (red) is acceleration dominant whereas athlete B (black) is speed dominant. Although these athletes are different, it is the context of a play that displays their strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Modernizing Old Models\nTo apply the models above, athletes must begin with zero velocity. This translates well to football because, all but one offensive athlete, cannot move until the ball is snapped. Unfortunately, unlike track sprinting, receivers rarely run linearly at maximal efforts. This hurdle makes it difficult to apply player profiling models in-game. If receivers are impeded during play, they risk losing speed and require more time to reach maximal velocity.\nThe concept is simple: which athlete reaches the intended destination first? Answering this question hinges on comparing athletes’ maximal potentials to cover distances in the time between the quarterback’s release of the ball and its arrival location. Thus, the models must be adjusted for time to be a function of velocity, acceleration, and distance.\nTime as a function of velocity, detailing how long it takes an athlete to reach a given speed:\n\\[\nv^{-1}(t) = ln[1- (\\frac{v}{v_\\max})]\\cdot\\tau\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is an athlete’s current speed and \\(0 \\leq v < v_\\max\\).\nTime as a function of distance, illustrating how long it takes to reach a position in space:\n\\[\n\\Delta d^{-1}(t) = \\tau \\cdot W(-e^\\frac{1 - \\Delta d}{\\tau \\cdot v_\\max}) + \\tau + \\frac{\\Delta d}{v_\\max}\n\\]\nwhere \\(W\\) is the Lambert W function and defined as the inverse of \\(xe^x\\). That is:\n\\[\ny=W(x)\\iff x=ye^y\n\\]\nFinally, to model the speed reached, having travelled a given distance, the function is as follows:\n\\[\nv^{-1}(\\Delta d) = v_\\max \\cdot (t + \\tau  e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau}) - (v_\\max \\cdot \\tau)\n\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is equal to \\(v^{-1}(t)\\).\n\n\n2.3 Midsprint\nWhen the quarterback releases the ball, athletes rarely have zero velocity. The models above depend on individuals starting their run from a dead start. To understand how long it will take an athlete to cover a distance when in motion, the following function was derived:\n\\[\nv^{-1}(\\Delta d^{-1} (t)) = [\\tau \\cdot W(-e^\\frac{1 - \\Delta d + d_0}{\\tau \\cdot v_\\max}) + \\tau + \\frac{\\Delta d + d_0}{v_\\max}] - [\\tau \\cdot W(-e^\\frac{1 - d_0}{\\tau \\cdot v_\\max}) + \\tau + \\frac{d_0}{v_\\max}]\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_0\\) is equal to \\(v^{-1}(\\Delta d)\\) when \\(v = 0\\). This function assumes that athletes are running at maximal effort when spanning distances."

At the time of the ball’s release, players had unique locations on the field. Distances were calculated for the receiver and primary defender from their respective positions to where the ball arrived. The time interval between the release and arrival of the football was also recorded.\nThe assumption dictates that the nearest defender was also the primary defender. Although this assumption may not always apply, it simplifies analyses.\n\n\n3.2 Calculating Outcomes\nBased on player speed and field position, the least amount of time required to travel from their current position to the ball’s destination was modeled. The time required to run this distance was based on the athlete’s unique force-velocity-power profile. As such, modeled outcomes are founded on the athlete arriving at the intended position with maximal effort and without impediment. Finally, pass outcomes were decided on whichever athlete arrived at the target destination first (offense: completion, defense: incompletion).\nAll analyses were completed in R 4.0.2."

    "text": "5 Discussion\nThis paper was influenced by the current literature surrounding force-velocity-power profiling from the NFL Combine’s 40-yard dash test. It provides a novel approach to modeling athletes’ mechanical sprint capabilities that utilizes positional tracking data. Presently, there is only one publication that also attempts to model athletes in-situ.\nOutcomes were recorded as whichever athlete arrived first at the intended destination, based on their unique profile. The model accurately predicted pass outcomes nearly 4 out of 5 plays. Modeling pass outcomes in this paper presented unique challenges. The model cannot take game factors into account like interference, routes, contact, jukes, and dekes. Rather, it assumes that players are running linearly at maximal effort, without obstructions. As demonstrated, the outcomes heavily favoured pass completions. This can be attributed to the fact that the receiver knows their routes while defenders lag and must react to a receiver’s movements.\n\n5.1 Positional F-V-P Profiles\nSecondary analyses revealed that receivers are acceleration-dominant. Wide receivers and tight ends are heavily acceleration-dominant with \\(\\tau\\) below 0.90 s. All other offensive positions are also acceleration-dominant but to a lesser degree. Defensively, only cornerbacks and safeties are acceleration-dominant with very similar maximal speed, maximal acceleration, and \\(\\tau\\) values (0.83 s) as receivers. All other defensive positions display balanced or speed-dominant profiles.\n\n\n5.2 Tuning the Model\nA large proportion of receivers decelerate when receiving a pass. This deceleration might be due to quarterbacks poorly leading receivers while in stride, or the receiver’s attempt to secure the football. It was also found that most defenders accelerate increase between ball release and arrival. Defenders were also found to increase their speeds between ball arrival and pass reception. These factors affected pass completion rates.\nThe model inaccurately predicts incompletions nearly 85% of the time. Further exploration identified that when the defender lags a receiver by less than 0.51 seconds to the point of arrival, as modeled when starting with zero velocity, it significantly decreases pass completion rates. Ergo, the proximity of a defender to the receiver coupled with the receiver’s deceleration dictates that the defense heavily influences pass outcomes between ball arrival and ball securement.\nThe model was rerun with the parameter that passes marked incomplete if the defender lags the receiver by a maximum of 0.51 seconds to the point of arrival. Results from this model increased the accuracy of identifying pass incompletions nearly 55%, and improved overall accuracy to 87.7%."

The research does not explore the correlation between results at the Combine and on-field performance. This paper illustrates that wide receivers,tight ends, and corner acks heavily rely on their rates of acceleration in-game. Moreover, they rarely reach speeds on the field that were reached during the NFL Combine’s 40-yard dash test. Scouts should focus on an athlete’s rate of acceleration, not their top-speed or 40-yard split, when assessing athletic abilities. The formulas presented in this paper, and the accompanying R package midsprint, provides scouts with a novel method of assessing prospects."

    "text": "The angle-velocity trade-off is the interplay between a player’s current speed and their ability to change direction. As such, we can theoretically identify the greatest speed an athlete can maintain for any given directional change. For example, if the punt returner catches the ball while in motion, they can maximize their change-of-direction ability which can help them effectively juke oncoming gunners. In doing so, the punt returner maximizes their punt return yardage. Punt returners who catch the ball while in motion also have increased risks of mistiming the catch and fumbling the ball. Therefore, this submission suggests that the punt returner should lateral the ball to a secondary player who is in motion to maximize return yardage while mitigating the risks."

    "text": "Background\nWhile the ball is in the air, the punt returner is looking up and receives information from teammates about oncoming gunners, play formations, and potential running routes. Once caught, the punt returner looks downfield, processes the information, and decides on their best course-of-action. If the punt returner has zero velocity at the time of the catch, they have limited ability to juke oncoming gunners. Instead, if the punt returner is provided cues from a teammate positioned obliquely on whether a lateral is appropriate, and the direction and distance of the lateral, the secondary player can process information about oncoming defenders effectively. In doing so, the secondary player can better process running routes while also maximizing their ability to effectively juke oncoming gunners.\nThis submission expands on previous work that modelled a player’s mechanical sprint ability (https://www.kaggle.com/aaronzpearson/modeling-player-biomechanics). The model introduced in this submission is based on the following paper which quantifies a player’s change-of-direction ability: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40279-018-0968-3. The authors state that a player’s intended change-of-direction impacts the maximal speed that they can maintain. For example, if a player is moving too quickly, they must decelerate to effectively manoeuvre on the field. The image below outlines the magnitude to which players must decelerate from maximal speeds to execute a given change-in-direction.\n Credit: Dos’Santos et al., 2018\nTherefore, this submission hypothesizes that a secondary player can earn greater return yardage than the punt returner. The hypothesis is based on the model proposed by Don’Santos et al., 2018 wherein a player in motion has a greater ability to change-direction and evade oncoming gunners."

    "text": "Methods\nData from the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 seasons were used to model a player’s change-of-direction ability. While cleaning the data, a player’s orientation was adjusted so that an orientation of 0 degrees resulted in the player facing the left goal-line. Orientation was then adjusted so that a player can rotate 0 to 180 degrees in either direction. Speed was binned every 0.2 yards/ second (i.e. (0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], etc.) and the greatest rate-of-change in orientation was extracted from the data set. Finally, a 3rd degree polynomial was fit to the data.\n\nModelling Change-of-Direction Ability\nThe change-of-direction ability between the gunner and secondary player were compared to assess the proposed model.\nThe secondary player was placed obliquely to the punt returner with 2.5 yards of lateral separation. They were assumed to run perpendicular to the punt returner and receive the ball 0.3 seconds after the punt is caught, parallel to the punt returner. The secondary player was also assumed to have a speed of 2.5 yards/ second (slow jog) when they received the lateral. Once the ball was secured, the secondary player was unimpeded in their maximal sprint efforts in any direction. The secondary player’s sprint abilities were previously modelled here [1]:\n\\[\nv(t) = v_\\max \\cdot (1-e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau})\\\\\n\\]\nwhere \\(v(t)\\) represents an athlete’s velocity at time \\(t\\), \\(v_\\max\\) is an athlete’s maximum speed, and \\(\\tau\\) is the acceleration constant calculated:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{v_\\max} {a_\\max}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_\\max\\) is an athlete’s maximum acceleration.\nThe secondary player’s sprint abilities were set as having a max speed of 10 yards/ second, a max acceleration of 15 yards/ second/ second, and a resulting acceleration constant of 0.67 seconds.\nFinally, the ability for a gunner to change direction was assessed. The gunner was assumed to be maintaining a consistent speed until the secondary player received the lateral. Once the secondary player has secured the ball and changed direction, the gunner would decelerate to the maximal speed for the intended change-of-direction to intercept the secondary player. The rate of deceleration over a given distance was modelled based on that of acceleration [2].\n\\[\n\\Delta d (t)= v_\\max \\cdot ((t + \\tau) \\cdot e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau}) - (v_\\max \\cdot \\tau)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta d(t)\\) represents the distance travelled from point \\(d_0\\) to \\(d_i\\) at time \\(t\\).\nTo model deceleration, the inverse of formula 1 was adjusted so that it took on a player’s current speed and goal speed (goal speed < current speed) [3]:\n\\[\nv^{-1}(t) = ln[1- (\\frac{v_i}{0.1} - 1)]\\cdot\\tau - ln[1 - (\\frac{v_n}{0.1} - 1)]\n\\]\nwhere \\(v_i\\) is the player’s current speed and \\(v_n\\) is the player’s goal speed. [2] was also adjusted so that the player’s max speed was replaced with the player’s current speed, and the time split, \\(t\\) was that from [3].\n\\[\n\\Delta d (t)= v_i \\cdot (t + \\tau \\cdot e^\\frac{-t}{\\tau}) - (v_i \\cdot \\tau)\n\\]"

Please note that fair catches were removed from this plot.\n\n\n\nChange of Direction\nChange of direction was capped at 90 degrees because it is unrealistic that a change-in-direction greater than such is feasible at 10Hz. Rather, it was assessed that such changes in direction were due to player impacts and improper data collection. The greatest rate-of-change was then modelled. The resulting model from the 2018-2019 (black) season followed the polynomial:\n\\[\ncod(v) = -15.85v + 4.41v^2 - 0.23v^3 + 63.89\n\\]\nwhere \\(cod(v)\\) is the player’s change-of-direction ability at a given speed, and \\(v\\) is a player’s speed in yards/ second.

Therefore, the gunner’s maximal sprint abilities would allow them to reach the punt returner in 1.51 seconds. These values were utilized in the example below.\n\nIn this example, the gunner has an initial maximum ability to change direction of 24.4 degrees. Within the secondary player’s allotted 1.21 seconds (1.51 seconds for the gunner to reach the punt returner minus 0.3 seconds for the lateral), they travelled linearly 7.83 yards. To intercept the secondary player, the gunner must change direction relative to the secondary player at 49.5 degrees. Therefore, the gunner must decelerate to 4.88 yards/ second which will take 0.77 seconds and 1.60 yards. This provides the gunner with 0.73 seconds to re-accelerate to reach the secondary player. In the example above, the time it takes to change direction and span the required distance takes a total of 2.30 seconds.

Finally, there is reason to believe that a secondary player provides an option for the receiving team in that the gunner must choose a player to attack. As such, the punt returner can decide which player the gunner has chosen and lateral the ball when appropriate.\n\nLimitations\nThis submission is based in theory.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Critical power is, theoretically, the work output that one can sustain indefinitely. The concept is that an individual will, after sustained maximal effort work, reach a point at which their aerobic energy systems match the demands placed on the muscle. Although there is some validity to the model, it remains idealistic and is contested in the literature.\nThe critical power model was initially proposed and assessed using individual muscles. Soon thereafter, the model was adopted by cyclists and adapted by swimmers and runners. Traditional testing, regardless of exercise modality, is for an athlete to perform several maximal-effort time trials. The results are plotted and a regression is fit to the data. The results are either a linear or hyperbolic function and can return an athlete’s critical power, their anaerobic energy capacity, and theoretical max speed. For example, the two-parameter model returns approximations of an athlete’s critical power (CP) and anaerobic energy reserve (W’). Conversely, the exponential decay model is empirical, and the values returned are hypothesized to represent various physiological metrics. Researchers are, typically, more interested in physiologically-rooted models because they are meant to represent phenomena that occur within the muscle.\n\\[\nP(t) = \\frac{W'}{t} + \\ CP \\ \\ ; \\ \\ two\\ parameter\\ model\n\\]\n\\[\nP(t) = 1/\\ t \\ \\ ; \\ \\ inverse\\ model\n\\]\nBy testing an athlete over various durations, researchers can plot the athlete’s power-duration curve. The power-duration curve describes an athlete’s theoretical maximal effort that can be sustained for a given duration or time. A result of the parabola is the ability to estimate an athlete’s capacity for any duration, eliminating the need for more time trials. Subsequently, by tracking a racer’s results, the power-duration curve can be updated to reflect improvements and decrements in their abilities.\nSeveral drawbacks exist regarding the critical power model. Primarily, researcher have argued that physiologically rooted models coincidentally coincide with metrics like critical power. This is because model parameters are fitted to minimize residual error. Therefore, the parameters should still be regarded as being empirical. Moreover, the models are constrained because they are limited in their ability to consider fatiguing factors beyond those in the muscle. For example, the two-parameter model was validated for durations between two and thirty minutes. During the first two minutes, the body is responding to the exercise demands. Since there is a delay, muscles are disproportionately reliant on anaerobic energy stores. One can envision this as there being a ramp increase in critical power until the steady-state is reached. When athletes surpass the 30-minute mark, fatigue develops locally and systemically. Although the model accounts for local, or muscular, fatigue accumulation, it cannot account for systemic factors that are beyond the muscle. Systemic fatigue accrued due to cardiovascular adjustment that stem from, for example, dehydration or decreases in central drive due to perceptual factors like pain cannot properly be modelled.\nSeveral models have attempted to expand and improve on the two-parameter model. The three-parameter and exponential models introduces a maximal-power (Pmax) parameter. In doing so, these models include a y-intercept which shifts the parabola left while still modelling the athlete’s critical power. These models were still limited in their ability to model critical power beyond thirty minutes.\n\\[\nP(t) = CP + \\frac{W'}{t + \\frac{W'}{(P_{max} - CP)}} \\ \\ ; \\ \\ three\\ parameter\\ model\n\\]\nRecently, the OmniDomain Power Duration model was developed to extend the two, three, and exponential critical power models beyond the thirty minute threshold. The researchers utilized Peronnet and Thibault’s previous work on Maximal Aerobic Power (latter portion of the model) which includes a decay function. This concept was utilized to model the decline in critical power with increasing duration.\n\\[\nP(t) = CP + \\frac{W'}{t} \\left[ 1 - e ^{-t \\left( \\frac{P_{max} - CP}{W'} \\right) } \\right] - A\\ln \\left( \\frac{t}{TCP_{max}} \\right) \\ \\ ; \\ \\ Extended\\ OmPD\\ Model\n\\]\nWith the adoption of fitness tracking and positional tracking devices, the critical power model can be adapted for runners and swimmers. The approach when testing critical velocity (CV) remains the same as it does for critical power. The only difference is that velocity can be substituted for power which results in the critical velocity model with the parameters being max distance travelled above critical velocity (D’) and maximal speed (Vmax)."

Luckily, a current project required a similar task and I figured that I would try my hand at profiling multiple athletes using the fvp package again.\nAn oversight of mine is that the fvp package isn’t setup to work well with the tidyverse (this might change with future updates). Therefore, we can’t rely on the group_by(), nest() and map() combination to apply functions to multiple players at once. Instead, we can rely on base R’s equivalent of split-apply-combine which, in this case, will rely on the split(), lapply(), and rbind() functions.\nFor this blog post, we’ll look at two scenarios: 1. creating a data.frame per athlete that can then be called upon for further analyses, and 2. reporting summarized data as a single data.frame."

    "text": "Best Sprints Data Sets\nFor this example, we’ll build a data set per player that returns their best on-field sprint. To do so, we’ll need the gps family of functions from fvp. Specifically, we’ll call the gps.best.sprint() function to return the player’s best observed, or actual, on-field sprint.\nThe gps.best.sprint() function takes on a few arguments: the game’s speed vector, the minimum starting speed for the sprint, and the percent of the player’s max speed that they must attain for us to consider the max effort sprint be achieved. Since player’s are often bumped at the beginning of each play, I set the minimum speed to 1 yd/s. I also set the percent of max speed to 95%. From experience, setting the percentage greater than 95% returns odd results because players don’t often reach their top speed more than 1-2 times per game.\nOne of the toughest parts of using lapply() is understanding the syntax. The first argument is the list onto which we want to apply a function. They second argument is the function we want to aply. That said, the function can either be pre-existing like in the example above. Otherwise, we can build a new function to incorporate different arguments.\nBelow, we must set the gps.best.sprint() function within another function. This way, we can consider x as the element of the list we want to apply the function. For this example, x represents the athletes’ data.frames.\n\nsprints <- lapply(player.df, \n                  function(x) gps.best.sprint(game.speed =  x$s, \n                                              min.speed = 1, \n                                              max.speed.threshold = 95)\n)\n\nlapply(sprints, head)\n\n$`2543699`\n  split.time observed.speed\n1        0.0           0.00\n2        0.1           0.87\n3        0.2           1.03\n4        0.3           1.25\n5        0.4           1.49\n6        0.5           1.75\n\n$`2550257`\n  split.time observed.speed\n1        0.0           0.00\n2        0.1           0.96\n3        0.2           1.66\n4        0.3           1.92\n5        0.4           2.19\n6        0.5           2.47\n\n\nWe can then plot the sprints by either combining the data sets and adding-in the player’s names, or by calling upon their position in the list of data.frames. Here, I went with the latter.\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n\nggplot(sprints[[1]], aes(x = split.time, y = observed.speed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = sprints[[2]], colour = \"red\") +\n  ylab(\"Observed Speed (yards/ s)\") +\n  xlab(\"Split Time (s)\")"

    "text": "Critical velocity typically requires athletes perform three-to-five-time trials at various distances. A parabolic function is then fit to the data, returning parameters that are meant to represent their max speed, critical velocity, and anaerobic capacity (D’).\nThe three-minute test is a validated method of assessing an athlete’s critical velocity and D’. The concept was that if an athlete were to run as far as possible in three minutes, their D’ would be depleted after approximately 150 s and their mean velocity between 150 s and 180 s is their critical velocity. Researchers working with field-sport athletes adapted the test so that participants performed shuttle runs. The change-of-direction was meant to represent the need to stop-and-start as they would during a competitive match.\nWith the recent push to assess an athlete’s fitness using positional tracking data, I have begun experimenting with ways of emulating the three-minute critical velocity test. The approach was to utilize in-game data to extract observations that are similar-enough to the three-minute test so that critical velocity can be approximated. Additionally, if the data adequately represented the three-minute test, D’ would be calculated.\nFinally, as a proof-of-concept, if critical velocity and D’ could be determined, the D’ balance model would be utilized to model and visualize the athlete’s anaerobic energy utilization per session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Apply the Critical Power model to your training programs with Training and Racing with a Power Meter \n          Sign-up for a free preview of the bookYou can unsubscribe anytime.

    "text": "Discussion\nCritical speed can be modeled using the models outlined above. The models return similar critical speed values and maximal speed. Anaerobic capacity, D’, ranges from 162.5 m to 371.1 m, which is a realistic range. Unfortunately, since D’ is highly variable, the utilization of the critical speed models are limited in their ability to predict race outcomes.\nParameters from the inverse and two parameter models are the same because the inverse model is derived from the two parameter model. Both models were included in the analyses to illustrate the various methods of modeling critical speed. Maximal speed returned from the three parameter and OmVD models are similar. The values returned are nearer to an individual’s maximal aerobic speed than a realistic maximal speed. This is probably a symptom of the data being simulated and can be addressed in the future.\nSubsequent analyses can explore how testing modalities affect the model fit. Moreover, with the popularity of positional tracking data, various methods of estimating critical speed have recently emerged and can be utilized in future work.\n\nReferences\nDrake, Jonah & Finke, Axel & Ferguson, Richard.

    "text": "Methods\nA single soccer player’s data was analyzed. The athlete participated in a total of 36 games and practices wearing a positional tracking unit.\nObservations were extracted similarly to those from Roecker and colleagues (2020). In the interest of time, the greatest average speed was retained for every second for each session. The max global speed for each time-point was then retained. The result was 41 data sets: 40 maximal average speed data sets, and 1 maximal average speed data set that incorporated the single greatest speed per duration.\nFollowing some experimentation, it was found that computing resources to calculate median velocities for 21 data points (as per Roecker and colleagues (2020)) are exponentially greater than calculating mean velocities. Since this is not publishable research, it was decided that the benefit to using maximal median values was outweighed by the amount of time needed to run the analyses.\nLastly, D’ was calculated as the mean velocity from 1 to 150 s multiplied by 150 minus the distance travelled at critical speed for the same duration and critical velocity was calculated as the average velocity between 151 s and 180 s.\n\\[\nD’ \\ = \\   \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{150}\\right) \\cdot 150 \\right)\\ – \\ \\left( CV  \\cdot 150 \\right)\n\\] where\n\\[\nCV = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(v_{151}+\\cdots+v_{180}\\right)\n\\]\nand \\(v\\) is the players greatest mean velocity for the given duration."

    "text": "Discussion\nThis post explored whether positional tracking data could be used in a similar fashion as the three-minute all-out critical velocity test to estimate an athlete’s critical velocity and D’. If D’ estimates were reasonable, a subsequent goal was to explore the athlete’s D’ balance during multiple sessions.\nThe results indicate that the methods described above have potential of estimating all of the parameters. Namely, critical velocity was within 10% of lab-tested critical velocity. This is well within reason seeing that previous research that explored the relationship between linear and shuttle run critical velocity tests returned a mean discrepancy of 17% favouring the linear test. D’ was 191 m which is on the mid- to low-end of previously reported D’ values. Although, discrepancies could results from: 1. the athletes that were previously tested were rugby players, and 2. the data acquired for this athlete was during their first 5 weeks of pre-season training. Therefore, the athlete could have been deconditioned or values may be depressed because the majority of the sessions were low-intensity practices.\nIn conclusion, there is reason to believe that this method could be used in team-sports to estimate critical velocity and D’. These parameters can then be used to track changes in fitness throughout a competitive season. Further explorations are warranted, and future posts will look into data from other soccer players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Apply the Critical Power model to your training programs with Training and Racing with a Power Meter \n          Sign-up for a free preview of the bookYou can unsubscribe anytime.

Independent sample t-tests were also run to identify potential differences in asymmetries between sexes.\nCohen’s d was used to assess the magnitude of the difference of effect size for the asymmetries between the sexes. Effect size was interpreted as suggested by Hopkins et al. (2009).\nFinally, relationships between asymmetry scores and physical performance were assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Relationships were established for the whole group and for each sex. Strength of the correlation was interpreted as suggested by Hopkins et al. (2009).\nThe authors did not state whether outliers were removed. Therefore, the analyses performed on the data includes all observations."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe results from the paper resemble those that were assessed in this post. Although, there are some key differences that should be addressed.\nPrimarily, the number of male and female participants in the provided data set do not match the reported number of males and females. This could be a typo in either the publication or the data set during anonymization. Moreover, there are missing observations in the data set that were not accounted for. This can be seen in the Descriptive Statistics section.\nThere are marked differences in mean and SD values. Although a significance test was not performed between the two, the results in this post should not differ from the publication. If issues arose from the misclassification of a participant, there shouldn’t be stark contrasts between the results here and the original publication. Rather, the individual’s results should have a minimal impact on the outcomes here.\nAlthough the data was tested for normality, the histograms reveal that much of the data was not actually normally distributed. This is due to various issues like outliers remaining in the data set. Subsequent analyses showed that some parameters included values that exceeded five SDs. Since these values exceed three SDs, rationale dictates that the values are either improperly recorded or are not representative of the sample size, and should be removed.\nFinally, the majority of the significance values (p-values) for the t-tests and correlations do not coincide between these results and the publication.\nIt is unclear why the results in this post do not match those in the original publication. It is prudent to say that the analyses in this post were completed incorrectly. Unfortunately, there is enough evidence suggesting that many of the analyses were completed correctly and that the results in the publication are subject to various typos or that statistical analyses were misinterpreted.\nFurther analyses should be completed that remove outliers and transform data to ensure that the data is normally distributed prior to completing statistical analyses. Many of the distributions returned to the user (see above) can be either log-transformed or a Box-Cox transformation, both of which can be easily back-transformed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Sign up below for a free preview of the NSCA's Essentials of Sport ScienceYou can unsubscribe anytime.

    "title": "The Critical Velocity Model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Several drawbacks exist regarding the critical power model. Primarily, researcher have argued that physiologically rooted models coincidentally coincide with metrics like critical power. This is because model parameters are fitted to minimize residual error. Therefore, the parameters should still be regarded as being empirical. Moreover, the models are constrained because they are limited in their ability to consider fatiguing factors beyond those in the muscle. For example, the two-parameter model was validated for durations between two and thirty minutes. During the first two minutes, the body is responding to the exercise demands. Since there is a delay, muscles are disproportionately reliant on anaerobic energy stores. One can envision this as there being a ramp increase in critical power until the steady-state is reached. When athletes surpass the 30-minute mark, fatigue develops locally and systemically. Although the model accounts for local, or muscular, fatigue accumulation, it cannot account for systemic factors that are beyond the muscle. Systemic fatigue accrued due to cardiovascular adjustment that stem from, for example, dehydration or decreases in central drive due to perceptual factors like pain cannot properly be modelled.\nSeveral models have attempted to expand and improve on the two-parameter model. The three-parameter and exponential models introduces a maximal-power (Pmax) parameter. In doing so, these models include a y-intercept which shifts the parabola left while still modelling the athlete’s critical power. These models were still limited in their ability to model critical power beyond thirty minutes.\n\\[\nP(t) = CP + \\frac{W'}{t + \\frac{W'}{(P_{max} - CP)}} \\ \\ ; \\ \\ three\\ parameter\\ model\n\\]\nRecently, the OmniDomain Power Duration model was developed to extend the two, three, and exponential critical power models beyond the thirty minute threshold. The researchers utilized Peronnet and Thibault’s previous work on Maximal Aerobic Power (latter portion of the model) which includes a decay function. This concept was utilized to model the decline in critical power with increasing duration.\n\\[\nP(t) = CP + \\frac{W'}{t} \\left[ 1 - e ^{-t \\left( \\frac{P_{max} - CP}{W'} \\right) } \\right] - A\\ln \\left( \\frac{t}{TCP_{max}} \\right) \\ \\ ; \\ \\ Extended\\ OmPD\\ Model\n\\]\nWith the adoption of fitness tracking and positional tracking devices, the critical power model can be adapted for runners and swimmers. The approach when testing critical velocity (CV) remains the same as it does for critical power. The only difference is that velocity can be substituted for power which results in the critical velocity model with the parameters being max distance travelled above critical velocity (D’) and maximal speed (Vmax).\n\n\nModelling Critical Velocity\nApart from the inverse model, critical velocity models are parabolic. The inverse model is a linear regression that can be achieved using the lm() function. Alternatively, fitting a non-linear regression in R is achieved using the nls() function. Both functions are native to R and do not rely on users installing external packages.\nUnlike the lm() function, nls() tasks users with setting initial parameter values. The function then optimizes the parameters to minimize residual errors. Subsequently, the starting values are consistently applied for all of the models such that critical velocity is 4 m/s, maximal speed is 9 m/s, and D’ is 150 m.\nBelow, critical velocity is modelled using the inverse, two parameter, three parameter, and OmniDomain velocity duration models. Seeing that the time trials do not extend beyond 30 minutes, the extended function within the OmVD model trends to zero. Therefore, the simple OmVD model will be utilized.\nBelow is a runner’s hypothetical time trial results. They completed four time trials over the course of two weeks, and ensured that fatigue accrued from previous sessions did not impact time trial performance.\n\n\nCode\ntime.trials <- data.frame(distance = c(800, 1600, 3200, 5000),\n                          duration = c(148.1, 326.6, 695.7, 1136.4),\n                          mean.speed = c(5.4, 4.9, 4.6, 4.4))\ntime.trials$inverse.duration <- 1/time.trials$duration\n\nknitr::kable(time.trials[, 1:3], col.names = c(\"Distance\", \"Duration\", \"Mean Velocity\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance\nDuration\nMean Velocity\n\n\n\n\n800\n148.1\n5.4\n\n\n1600\n326.6\n4.9\n\n\n3200\n695.7\n4.6\n\n\n5000\n1136.4\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInverse ModelTwo ParameterThree ParameterOmVD\n\n\n\ninv.formula <- \"mean.speed ~ inverse.duration\"\ninv.model <- lm(inv.formula, data = time.trials)\n\n\n\n\ntwo.param.formula <- \"mean.speed ~ d.prime/ duration + crit.speed\"\ntwo.param <- nls(two.param.formula, data = time.trials, start = c(d.prime = 150, crit.speed = 4))\n\n\n\n\nthree.param.formula <- \"mean.speed ~ crit.speed + d.prime / (duration + d.prime / (max.speed - crit.speed))\"\nthree.param <- nls(three.param.formula, data = time.trials, start = c(crit.speed = 4, d.prime = 150, max.speed = 9))\n\n\n\n\n# since the data is simulated, nls() needs controls in place so that it doesn't return a warning or error \nomvd.formula <- \"mean.speed ~ crit.speed + d.prime * (1 - exp(-1 * duration * (max.speed - crit.speed)/ d.prime))/ duration\"\nomvd <- nls(omvd.formula, data = time.trials, start = c(crit.speed = 4, d.prime = 150, max.speed = 9),\n            control = nls.control(warnOnly = TRUE, minFactor = 1e-5, tol = 1e-10), \n            algorithm = \"port\", lower = c(2, 100, 5,8))"
